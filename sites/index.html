<h3><a href="lamp.html"><img alt="LAMP" src="../image/1.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;"/>Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) primer design tool</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.neb.com/en/applications/dna-amplification-pcr-and-qpcr/isothermal-amplification/loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp" target="_blank">Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification</a> (LAMP) uses 4-6 primers recognizing 6-8 distinct regions of target DNA for a highly specific amplification reaction. LAMP is a highly sensitive, specific, and rapid DNA amplification technique that has revolutionized molecular biology research and clinical diagnostics. LAMP reactions occur under isothermal conditions, and do not require special thermal cyclers. The LAMP assay can also be used for bisulfite LAMP primer design.</p><br />

<h3><a href="assembly.html"><img alt="Gibson Assembly" src="../image/015.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;"/>Gibson assembly primer design tool</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.snapgene.com/guides/gibson-assembly" target="_blank">Gibson Cloning</a> is a technique for assembling DNA constructs that allows multiple linear segments to be joined either into a single large linear segment or, if the segments contain the appropriate components and overlap, into an intact plasmid. An isothermal, single-reaction method for the assembly of multiple overlapping DNA molecules by the concerted action of a 5′ exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase. This assembly method can be used to seamlessly construct synthetic and natural genes, genetic pathways and entire genomes, and could be a useful molecular engineering tool.</p><br />
